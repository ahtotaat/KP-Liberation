        _classname  - Classname of the vehicle to spawn [STRING, defaults to ""]
        _side       - Side of the vehicle               [SIDE, defaults to KPLIB_preset_sideE]
        _kind       - Kind of the vehicle (light/heavy) [STRING, defaults to "light"]

    Returns:
        Spawned vehicle [OBJECT]

/* !NOTE!
    Adding a patrol waypoint pattern to the vehicle let it move like the infantry squads, which is the same like in the old framework.
    Unfortunately this leads to the behaviour that they can get stuck and drive over their homies with no regrets.
    So we could let them spawn standing still and just "scan the area" or we keep it like in the old framework and let them drive around.
    Personally I think both options aren't the best in their current implementation, but I would prefer them to just stand.
