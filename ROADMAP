Priorities...

* Support one or more HQ spawn points
  - Altis: baseline default is one, lower deck U.S.S. Liberty
  - goal: add ability to treat that as an array set of them
  - impact: for things like within or without distances, ranges, to/from HQ, etc
  - informed by: considering the legacy code base, pending refactor review
  - there are a half dozen uses of the "KPLIB_eden_startbase" variable
  - also of a static "KPLIB_eden_startbase_marker", which we think should be dynamically created, besides...
  - informed by variables placed on the "startbase" proxy
  - and which requires a functional API of its own, perhaps "06 Start base"

* Logistics is evidently, clearly, massively undone
  - captured a factory, no notification whatsoever (separate issue)
  - no crates spawning or parachuting in upon building FOB
  - no crates appearing, evidently, when factory sector spawns in
  - unable to build storage at a factory, pending refactor review
  - log dialog will require some consideration, as will a log persistence element
  - whole lot of things have to happen there, starting with establishing factory tuples, dialog cfg, FSMs, etc

* Minor points
  - Recycle not working on "free" assets (?)
    . Does recycle ability require the GC structure? probably, would make some sense...

# not sure how that can be considered "done", with done being a legit claim

# same here, marked "done", but nothing apparently done about it

# Let's start by saying, the framework is in its infancy
# It is playable, to a point, but it is as I suspected
# There are a handful, perhaps half a dozen or a dozen semi-non-trivial aspects standing between where it is now and being "ready up" for prime time
# Below is a list of observations...

# evaluating the rewrite ...

* starting HQ is the LIBERTY
 - which is fine...
 - but should also support potentially multiple HQ spawn points...
 - LIBERTY upper and lower decks, for instance
 - as well as ostensibly including the FREEDOM

* the mission sitrep overlay is not there yet (?)
 - just not there whatsoever from what I can tell
 - not sure if that is an oversight or it requires further attention...

* do not like the build placement...
 - was formerly a ghost shell, you could rotate it in hand, adjust, etc
 - advantage, you could align it with your compass
 - in the new mode, not sure how that aligns (or not) with any compass indicators
 - or at least being able to observe the bits as they rotate...
 - can they be raised, lowered, etc...
 - entering into a "build mode" is interesting however...
 - at least the FOB area reload seems to be intact, not bouncing items around
   . i.e. meaning that more than likely item re-creation is happening with the correct opts

* no crates spawning to start with
 - though to their credit, storage can be built
 - looks like menu actions are there at least in name for "expected" lib log
 - could add the improvement, "consolidate crates" ...

* spawn range seems excessive, >1km, to start
 - adjust to taste
 - also, "cool down" seems rather quick as well; soon as you leave the area, the units are recycled
   . which is a good thing, but is it a "cool down" conf (?)

* entering Zeus is possible
 - however is EXTREMELY LIMITED
 - cannot pan back in the camera but maybe 100m in any axis
 - cannot set camera to a spot on the map, presumably for the same reasons
   . probably a Zeus setting, need to review those...

* build cost tables of course need to be established

* notifications when sectors are captured?

* how to "opt in" to optional modules, i.e. "prod", "log" (?)
 - "22 prod" is absent... not there
  - no opt to build storage at captured factory
  - nor are there any indications re: prod capabilities
    . seems like a huge gap in the game play aspect
  - this whole aspect just seems undone, unfinished, if it was ever started

* recycle not connected to menus yet
 - some of the functions appear to be there
 - but no menu actions yet
 - possibly other "standard" liberation menu actions

* will also want to get familiar with side mission scaffolding
 - it could be an improvement over the previous static compile time
 - will need to review it however

* what is a "25 Friendly Commander Managing Dialog" (?)

* maps starting with Altis
 - would need to introduce other maps
 - assuming game play is "ready up"

# before even considering anything else
