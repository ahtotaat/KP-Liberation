## Current business - 2021-01-31 21:41:52

1. Sprint `0.98.dev-s1`

1. Picking up the pieces from where the _KP Liberation_ team left off

1. Allowing for one or more Eden start bases, use cases:
    1. _U.S.S. Liberty_ upper and lower decks
    1. Plus _U.S.S. Freedom_
    1. Also allowing for more flexibility deploying _assets_ to a _flight deck_

1. Allowing for more dynamic proxy asset placement
    1. Allowing for turret placements by proxy
        1. With _optional crew_

1. Started identifying a common _sectors tuple_ shape
    1. Initially with _Eden_ and _FOB_ tuples
        1. We think potentially extending into _factories_, etc
        1. We are not thrilled about the draft shape as it stands, so will take a little time next sprint to settle on a better shape

## Future business

1. Sprint `0.98.dev-s2`

1. We will spend a little time with the tuple shape to start with and put that to bed
    1. Expecting that will ripple throughout the code so keeping that to a minimum
    1. The goal is to capture commonly used fields in a single place
    1. Especially such that tuple deconstruction via the `params` operator does not incur too many in the way of intermediate or leading variables

1. We want to renumber the modules
    1. Especially after we added or refactored some half dozen or so in the previous sprint
    1. Future goals with this one is to leave room for future growth
    1. From a pragmatic perspective will amount to adding one or two digits to the numbering scheme

1. We are not happy with how objects are aligned with the terrain
    1. In particular with respect to the _FOB building_
        1. Will verify for other objects as well
    1. We think objects should be built and/or aligned in the proper direction and up alignment

1. We think that objects caught up in the persistence loop may be persisting no matter what
    1. And no matter where they are
        1. i.e. In local scenario I have a _FOB building_ that is caught out in the middle of nowhere
        1. Totally a fluke but it was built and with persistence trapping it before a _FOB tuple_ breakage interrupted
    1. Probably a fluke and may never happen in production but worth a brief look anyway
        1. At the very least, ask about objects within or without an _FOB_, designate accordingly, whether stolen enemy assets, etc
        1. Then leave them in or out of the persistence queue

1. We want to start dissecting the production aspects
    1. We think the constraint on this will be connecting the dots with actual _resources_
        1. Besides also being able to _build storage areas_ at a _factory_ site, which is also part of it
        1. Which _storage_ and _resources_ will wait for a future sprint
    1. We will want to _design a dialog_ in the new manner of managing the _production_ features themselves
    1. We also want to consider translating some _production_ [_state machine_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) work we did in a legacy draft
        1. i.e. Potentially even transliteraing that level of effort to a first class [_Arma 3 Finite State Machine_](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/execFSM) ([FSM](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/FSM))
        1. Will require getting our feet wet with the [`FSM Editor`](...)
            1. Although I think it is also worthwhile comprehending the nuts and bolts if it is not too difficult to grasp
    1. Which will also include transliterating some _timers_ work we did in that draft
        1. We may be able to leverage that, or we may see if [_CBA_](...) does not have something for us to leverage
        1. Want to look for [_timers_](...) in particular... but also want to consider simply connecting with the [_event system_](...)
    1. That is, if we do not also want to consider a [_Visual Studio Code_](...) extension for the same
